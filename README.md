# TokeaApp

This is an event booking app created with the ReactJS library. The app allows users to navigate through a variety of upcoming events, view their dates, venues, and locations through visually designed images. Users can also calculate the cost of events based on the selected event and the number of tickets.
How It's Made

The app is built using ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. ReactJS provides a component-based architecture, allowing for the creation of reusable UI components and efficient rendering of dynamic content. The app utilizes React's features such as Context API, React Routes, and the useParams hook for enhanced navigation and data management.

# Functionality

The Ticketify app provides the following functionality:

Event Navigation: Users can browse through a variety of upcoming events. Each event is presented with its date, venue, and location, accompanied by visually designed images to enhance the user experience.

Ticket Cost Calculation: Users can select an event and specify the number of tickets they wish to purchase. The app calculates the total cost based on the selected event's ticket price and the chosen quantity.

Single Event Page: The app utilizes React Routes and the useParams hook to enable navigation to a dedicated page for each event. Users can access more detailed information about a specific event, including additional images, descriptions, and other relevant details.

# What I Have Learned

During the development of this Event Booking app, I have gained valuable knowledge and experience in the following areas:

ReactJS: I have furthered my understanding of ReactJS and its component-based architecture, allowing for reusable and efficient UI development.

Context API: I have utilized the Context API to manage global state and provide data and functionality across different components without the need for prop drilling.

React Routes: I have implemented React Routes to enable navigation between different pages and facilitate a smooth user experience in the app.

useParams Hook: I have utilized the useParams hook to extract parameters from the URL and dynamically retrieve data for a specific event page.

By working on this project, I have improved my skills in ReactJS development, learned how to manage application state using Context API, implemented navigation using React Routes, and leveraged the useParams hook for dynamic content retrieval.
